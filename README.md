# Geo-Fencing Attendance Management System (GFAMS)

This repository contains the source code for the GFAMS project, a location-aware attendance management system designed for educational institutions.

## Project Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo with a clear separation between the frontend mobile application and the backend server.

*   `./frontend/`: Contains the Flutter mobile application for students, lecturers, and admins.
*   `./backend/`: Contains the Django REST Framework API server that powers the application.

For detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and contribute to a specific part of the project, please refer to the `README.md` file located within each of those directories.
